Pure-Swift Bitcoin client implementation with full node capabilities.

## Overview

Swift Bitcoin is comprised of several core components. The main entry-point is the `Bitcoin` framework which can be easily integrated into virtually all types of Swift projects.

### Bitcoin Node

The [Bitcoin Node (bcnode)](https://swift-bitcoin.github.io/docc/bcnode/documentation/bcnode/) command-line tool is used to launch a Bitcoin RPC server and peer-to-peer network client.

### Bitcoin Utility

The [Bitcoin Utility (bcutil)](https://swift-bitcoin.github.io/docc/bcutil/documentation/bcutil/) command-line tool can be used to perform off-chain wallet operations as well as controlling a running node instance via RPC.
